  description: "When I saw a huge flock of birds in the sky, I knew it wouldn\u2019t
    end well. They were probably there since that fateful day, and my ship was the
    first land they found. They attacked the ship, tearing the sails and ropes. If
    they had gotten inside, I wouldn\u2019t have survived."
