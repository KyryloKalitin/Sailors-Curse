  description: When I discovered that there was no food in the storeroom, I was ready
    to give up hope. But while exploring the cabins, I found a stash with a small
    supply of canned goods. Apparently, one of the sailors was stealing food from
    the storeroom, and thanks to him, I have a chance to live a little longer.
