  _description: My ship arrived at an absolutely dreadful place, surrounded by wreckage,
    with polluted water. Underwater lay a destroyed nuclear station, emitting tons
    of radiation. I immediately reinforced the walls with planks while my ship distanced
    itself from the area as far as possible. I don't think I'll die, but I feel terrible;
    I'll try to recover with food and water. It's a pity there wasn't anything to
    warn me about this.
