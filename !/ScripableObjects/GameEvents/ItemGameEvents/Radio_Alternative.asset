  description: "My ship reached a terrible place with broken parts and dirty water
    all around. Under the water, there was a destroyed nuclear station giving off
    radiation. I quickly put up extra boards on the walls, and the ship moved away
    as far as it could. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll die, but I feel very bad. I\u2019ll
    try to feel better with some food and water. It\u2019s a shame there was no warning
    about this."
