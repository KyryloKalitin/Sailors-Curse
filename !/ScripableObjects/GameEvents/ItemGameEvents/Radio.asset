  _description: I was certain I wouldn't find any use for the radio, except perhaps
    as a footrest, but unexpectedly received a signal emitted not far from my location.
    Upon arrival, all I found were wreckage of a ship and floating crates of provisions.
    I'll never know if that signal was emitted on that fateful day or if I had arrived
    earlier, I could have found people. In any case, they no longer need these supplies.
