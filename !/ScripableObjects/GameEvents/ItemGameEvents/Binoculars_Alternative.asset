  description: "My daytime nap was cut short by an unexpected explosion that shook
    my ship. I went out onto the deck and saw barrels in the water labeled as explosive\u2014probably
    from a sunken factory or something like that. Luckily, most of the contents had
    spoiled, or the ship would have been destroyed. Still, I didn\u2019t come out
    of it unharmed. I need a way to explore underwater to avoid surprises like this."
