  _description: My daytime nap was interrupted by an unexpected explosion that rocked
    my ship. Risking it, I went out onto the deck and noticed barrels in the water
    marked as explosive, probably from a submerged factory or something similar.
    I was lucky that most of the contents inside had spoiled; otherwise, the ship
    would have been blown to pieces. However, I still didn't escape unscathed. I
    need to find a way to explore the depths of the water to avoid such surprises.
