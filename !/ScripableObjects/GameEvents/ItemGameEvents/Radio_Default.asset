  description: "I thought the radio would be useless, maybe just something to rest
    my feet on. But then I unexpectedly picked up a signal nearby. When I got there,
    I only found a shipwreck and crates of supplies floating around. I\u2019ll never
    know if the signal was sent on that day or if I could have found people if I'd
    arrived sooner. Either way, they don\u2019t need these supplies anymore."
